Healthcheck Your Site!

## Summary

Every site is "healthy" until it isn't. Don't leave things to chance by doing a site health check!

In this session we'll introduce the tools and techniques to perform a health-check on your Drupal site using easy, off-the-shelf tools. We'll outline the goals of the health check, and what to do if you discover something wrong, or worse, how to recover from a hack.

Knowledge of Drupal, business processes, and the command line are helpful, but not required.
